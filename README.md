# AutoInsure

A Car Insurance & Rental website I’ve built, featuring Axios, Cors, React-Router, React-Select, SwiperJS and more. My experience in the Lloyds Insurance Group has lead me to build this project.

## Lessons I Learned

This project was a true dive in the deep-end; it is a Full-Stack project that encompasses the Front-End (React) with Back-End (NodeJS, Express, SQL). For this, I had to learn the basics of NodeJS & Express; so, I could link these together.

Initially, I wanted to use React to handle the forms, however I found that these didn’t link well with ’sort’ dropdown for the ‘Browse’ page, so I switched to React-Select for the ‘Sort’ dropdown. I also realized that this condensed my code, and also, the website performed slightly better with this method, especially the link between React and NodeJS/SQL (backend).

I also learned a lot about website deployment; specifically, how to deploy a full website. Honestly, it was a challenge in the beginning; I ran into many bugs during deployment, so I decided to switch from Heroku.com to Render.com for the backend, and I stuck with Netlify for the front-end, and this worked. I have much more to say about this project, as I enjoyed it so much, however I do not want this .readme file to turn into a 7-series book, so I will stick with this.

## Potential Future Features/Additions

* Add a Saved/Wishlist to the site, so users could save their favorite cars
* Add a .map to the ‘Compare Car’ info sections, instead of hard-coding
* I initially wasn’t able to tie 'select' tags sort with state in Browse page, had to use another way (React-Select)
* Reduce Image Sizes to improve the performance of the website
* Add an internal Blog Site section within the website.

## Web Deployment

The Front-End of this website was deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and the Back-End of this website was deployed with [Render](https://render.com/).
